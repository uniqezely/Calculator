# Calculator
 First program using python lots of fun kinda confusing... I have a long way to go with github and python kinda confused on how to use this platform but had lots of fun doing this. I learned mostly from the a yt tutorial so not really my own but agian my goal is understanding how this code works not doing it from scratch....
